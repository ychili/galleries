Galleries
=========

A "gallery" is a directory that you wish to tag.
Gallery paths, their file counts, their tags,
and whatever other metadata you want get stored in one central CSV file.

If you like manually editing CSV and lots of different config files,
this might be the project for you.

Features:

-   Tag search
-   Keep galleries' file counts updated, tags tidy
-   Add tags by implication
-   Study tag relationships

Requirements
------------

-   Python 3.10+
-   [Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/)
-   [Tomli](https://github.com/hukkin/tomli),
    if using a Python older than 3.11
